## Aurora Editor Sunset Announcement

After much thought and consideration, we have decided to officially sunset Aurora Editor.  
Aurora started as a community-driven effort to build a fast, lightweight, and truly native IDE for macOS developers. It grew out of passion, collaboration, and a shared vision for an open alternative. Along the way, contributors poured in their time, energy, and creativity to shape what Aurora became.  
But as with all projects, there comes a time to reflect on sustainability and focus. With limited resources, shifting priorities, and new tools emerging in the developer ecosystem, we believe it’s the right moment to bring Aurora Editor’s journey to a graceful close.  
The code will remain available on GitHub for anyone who wishes to explore, fork, or continue the vision in new directions. We deeply appreciate everyone who wrote code, opened issues, shared feedback, or simply used Aurora in their daily work-you kept the project alive and meaningful.  
Thank you for being part of Aurora’s story!  
Even though Aurora Editor is setting, the light it inspired will live on in the community.

# AuroraEditor LLDB

AuroraEditor LLDB is an open-source debugger project inspired and influenced by several notable repositories, including:

1. [apple/llvm-project](https://github.com/apple/llvm-project/tree/next/lldb)
2. [apple/swift-lldb](https://github.com/apple/swift-lldb)
3. [llvm/llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/lldb)

Debugging is a complex task, especially when it involves multiple current and future programming languages. The goal of AuroraEditor LLDB is to create a debugger that can seamlessly debug various languages natively in Swift. This approach is aimed at ensuring compatibility with [AuroraEditor](https://github.com/AuroraEditor/AuroraEditor) and providing optimal performance.

While it may not be possible to entirely implement the debugger in Swift due to certain system-level requirements often associated with debuggers, our aim is to replicate the functionality to the best of our abilities within the Swift ecosystem.

## Project Status

There is no fixed timeline for the completion of AuroraEditor LLDB. Building debuggers is a challenging endeavor, much like developing an editor. However, we have a strong foundation and valuable references thanks to the contributions and insights from Apple and the LLVM community.

We invite developers and contributors to join us on this journey to create a powerful, Swift-native debugger that enhances the debugging experience for various programming languages. Your contributions and support are greatly appreciated as we work towards making AuroraEditor LLDB a robust and versatile debugging tool.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the open-source community. If you are interested in participating in the development of AuroraEditor LLDB, please review our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get started.
